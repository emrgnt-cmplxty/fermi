title: Learn About Sui
---

*Sui: pronounced "sweet" without the "T" - with Transactions (loads of them), things are SWEET indeed. :-)*

Welcome to the documentation for the Sui platform. Sui is built on the core [Move](https://github.com/MystenLabs/awesome-move) programming language. This documentation assumes that you have a basic working knowledge of Move. To learn more about the differences between core Move and Sui Move, see [How Sui Move differs from core Move](../learn/sui-move-diffs.md).

For a deep dive into Sui technology, see the [Sui Smart Contracts Platform](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/doc/paper/sui.pdf) white paper. Find answers to common questions about our [roadmap](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/DEVX_ROADMAP.md) and more in our [FAQ](../contribute/faq.md).

## Versions of the documentation

This site is available in two versions. You can choose which version to view using the drop-down menu at top left.
 * [Devnet](https://docs.sui.io/devnet/learn) reflects the stable `devnet` branch of the repo. Use the **Devnet** version of the docs if you build or test with the `devnet` branch of the repo. 
 * [Latest build](https://docs.sui.io/learn) reflects the `main` branch of the repo. The `main` branch includes the most recent updates we've made to the documentation. The `main` branch includes updates not yet merged into the `devnet` branch.

 When Sui releases a new feature, or change to an existing feature, to the `devnet` branch, the documentation in the **Devnet** version may not reflect the associated updates for a few days after the release. You can see the associated updates in the **Latest build** version in the interim.  

## Sui releases

Check for the latest release of Sui, including Release Notes, on the [Sui Releases](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/releases) page.

### Doc updates

We list changes and updates to the documentation in the [Sui documentation updates](../learn/sui-doc-updates.md) topic.

See the [docs-related commit history](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/commits/main/doc/src) in the Sui repo.

### Code changes

### Write Smart Contracts with Move

Go to the [Move Quick Start](../build/move/index.md) for information about installation, defining custom objects, object operations (create/destroy/update/transfer/freeze), publishing, and invoking your published code.

### Start the Sui network with Sui CLI client

See the [Sui CLI client Quick Start](../build/cli-client.md) for information about installation, querying the chain, client setup, sending transfer transactions, and viewing the effects.

### Take the end-to-end tutorial

Proceed to the [Sui Tutorial](../explore/tutorials.md) for a summary view of setting up your environment, starting a Sui network, gathering accounts and gas, and publishing and playing a game in Sui.

### Program with Objects

Finish with the detailed [Programming with objects](../build/programming-with-objects/index.md) tutorial series offering detailed guidance on manipulating Sui objects, from creation and storage through wrapping and using child objects.
