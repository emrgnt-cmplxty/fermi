  "description": "Note: Simulation tests are no longer actively supported. Axion Simulator was meant to be an in-place replacement of a blockchain environment for the purpose of testing Axion contracts. However, simulating Axion ledger turned out to be a much more complex endeavor than was anticipated. Eventually, the idea of workspaces was born - a library for automating workflows and writing tests for Axion smart contracts using a real Axion network (localnet, testnet or mainnet). Thus, Axion Simulator is being deprecated in favor of workspaces-rs, the Rust edition of workspaces. As the two libraries have two vastly different APIs this guide was created to ease the migration process for developers.",
