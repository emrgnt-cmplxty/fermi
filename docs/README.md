## Contributing

Axion uses [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) for documentation.  Please refer to their documentation for details on major structural contributions to the documentation.

For simple content changes you have 2 options

- [Submit an issue](https://github.com/axion/docs/issues)
- [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/axion/docs/pulls) *(we prefer PRs of course)*

### The instant PR

This is the fastest way to submit content changes directly from the page where you notice a mistake.

1. Open any page in the docs on https://docs.axion.org
2. Click the `[ Edit ]` button at the top right hand side of _every_ content page
3. Make your edits to the document that opens in GitHub by clicking the ✎ (pencil) icon
4. Submit a PR with your changes and comments for context

### The typical PR

This is the standard fork-branch-commit workflow for submitting pull requests to open source repositories

1. Fork this repo to your own GitHub account (or just clone it directly if you are currently a member of Axion)

2. Open your editor to the _top level repo folder_ to view the directory structure as seen below

3. Move into the `/website` folder where you will run the following commands:

   - Make sure all the dependencies for the website are installed:

     ```sh
     # Install dependencies
     yarn
     ```

   - Run the local docs development server

      ```sh
      # Start the site
      yarn start
      ```

      _Expected Output_

      ```sh
      # Website with live reload is started
      LiveReload server started on port 35729
      Docusaurus server started on port 3000
      ```

      The website for docs will open your browser locally to port `3000` 

4. Make changes to the docs

5. Observe those changes reflected in the local docs

6. Submit a pull request with your changes

## Found a broken link?

For broken links internal to the docs, please submit an issue or PR request as per above.

If you found a broken link from a Google search, please request to remove it from their index here: https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/removals

### Check for broken links before pushing

Contributors, please consider checking for broken links executing the file `test-links.sh` before pushing to this repo so our CI doesn't fail, forcing someone (maybe you) to fix broken links before merging.


> _Here's one way to always make this happen automatically on every push:_
> 
> Note that the file `test-links.sh` mimics the CI build script by checking all links then cleaning itself up.
> 
> 1. Create a new githook in your local copy of the repo called `.git/hooks/pre-push` and copy the entire contents of the snippet below into that file.
> 2. Now every time you try to push to the repo, links will be checked for you automagically.
>
> ```bash
> #!/bin/sh
> 
> set -e
> 
> echo "Push detected in Axion docs repo"
> 
> if [[ $NEAR__CHECK_ALL_LINKS ]]
> # only stop and check all links if this is enabled
> # since it request npm installed (uses npx) and can generally be surprising to new contributors
> then
>     echo "Checking all links before push"
> 
>     GIT_DIR=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
> 
>     cd "$GIT_DIR/website"
> 
>     ./test-links.sh
> else
> # just let them know there's a way to do this before every push
>     echo "export NEAR__CHECK_ALL_LINKS=1 to check all links before pushing"
>     echo
> fi
> ```
