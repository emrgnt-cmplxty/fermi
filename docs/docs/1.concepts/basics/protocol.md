Fermi is a SDK that allows developers to build **webscale applicatitons within a sovereign blockchain**. 

Fermi is powered by PoS [DAG-based BFT consensus](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.05677.pdf). Fermi allows developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) which can operate in excess of 100k TPS.

## Why Choose Fermi? {#why-build-on-near}
Fermi allows developers to build the most scaleable blockchains on the planet.

### New Unlocks
Fermi offers unparalleled TPS which opens a whole new world of dApps - potential use cases range from finance to gaming to social media.  

### Ecosystem Connectivity
The Fermi hub publishes aggregate state proofs for connected chains which allows seamless and secure cross-chain connectivity across the entire ecosystem.  

### Easy Building
Written in Rust with performance in mind so that developers can spend more time building and less time optimizing
