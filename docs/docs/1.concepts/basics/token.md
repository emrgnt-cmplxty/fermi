# Fermi Token
This is the native token used in Fermi Protocol.
It has multiple use cases:
- Secures the network through staking
- Provides a unit of account - Fermi is used for processing transactions and storing data
- Serves as a medium of exchange

### Securing the Network
Fermi Protocol is a proof-of-stake (PoS) network, which means that resistance from various attacks comes from staking Fermi.
Staked Fermi represents the decentralized infrastructure of servers that maintain the network and process transactions for applications and users on Fermi.
Rewards for providing this service are received in Fermi.

## Providing a Unit of Account
Fermi is used to price computation and storage on the Fermi infrastructure.
The network charges transaction fees in Fermi to process changes and transactions.

## Medium of Exchange
Fermi is readily available on the protocol level, so it can be used to transfer value between Fermi applications and accounts.
This means that applications can use Fermi to charge for various functions, like access to data or other complex transactions.
Entities can also easily exchange Fermi between each other, without the need for trusted third parties to clear and settle transactions.
