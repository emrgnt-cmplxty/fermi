Axion is a SDK that allows developers to build **webscale applicatitons within a sovereign blockchain**. 

Axion is powered by PoS [DAG-based BFT consensus](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.05677.pdf). Axion allows developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) which can operate in excess of 100k TPS.

## Why Choose Axion? {#why-build-on-near}
Axion allows developers to build the most scaleable blockchains on the planet.

### New Unlocks
Axion offers unparalleled TPS which opens a whole new world of dApps - potential use cases range from finance to gaming to social media.  

### Ecosystem Connectivity
The Axion hub publishes aggregate state proofs for connected chains which allows seamless and secure cross-chain connectivity across the entire ecosystem.  

### Easy Building
Written in Rust with performance in mind so that developers can spend more time building and less time optimizing
