Once you finished developing your smart contract please go through the following list in order to ensure everything is safe for the end user.

### Anatomy
1. There are no `private` methods marked as public by mistake

### Environment
2. `predecessor` and `signer` are used correctly through the entire contract

### Storage
3. Each time the state grows it is ensured that there is enough Balance to cover it
4. All collections (i.e. Vector, Map, Tree, etc) have an unique id
5. Check for underflows and overflows!. In rust, you can do this by simply adding the `overflow-checks = true` flag in your `Cargo.toml`.

### Actions
6. When sending money, you left enough in the contract to cover the storage cost

### Callbacks
7. All private callbacks are marked as `[#private]` in Rust, or `assert` the caller (`predecessor`) is the contract (`current_account`)
8. All cross-contract calls have a callback that checks for errors and rolls back the state if necessary
9. All cross-contract calls have a callback that checks for errors and returns money to the `predecessor` if necessary
10. All the callbacks are given enough GAS to finish without errors
11. The contract is not left in a exploitable state between a cross-contract call and its callback
