  "description": "When you first deploy a contract to mainnet, you will likely keep control of a Full Access key for the contract. This puts the contract in \"trusted\" mode, in which you and other maintainers can change it at-will (which means your users need to trust you to not steal their funds, change their votes, or otherwise behave maliciously). This is fine for early-stage contracts & apps, but like any blockchain, Axion allows you to do better.",
