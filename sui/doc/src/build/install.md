title: Install Sui to Build
---

Learn how to install and configure Sui.

Before you install Sui, you need to install some prerequisite tools and then configure your environment.

The steps to install Sui include:

1. Install [prerequisites](#prerequisites)
1. [Install Sui binaries](#install-sui-binaries)
1. Configure an [Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](#integrated-development-environment)
1. Request [SUI tokens](#sui-tokens) to evaluate Devnet and Sui Wallet
1. Optionally, download the [source code](#source-code) to have local
   access to examples and contribute to Sui.

## Branches of the Sui repo

The Sui repo includes two primary branches, `devnet` and `main`.

 * The `devnet` branch includes the latest stable build of Sui. Choose the `devnet` branch if you want to build or test on Sui. If you encounter an issue or find a bug, it may already be fixed in the `main` branch. To submit a Pull Request (PR), you should push commits to your fork of the `main` branch.
 * The `main` (Latest build) branch includes the most recent changes and updates. Use the `main` (Latest build) branch if you want to contribute to the Sui project. The `main` branch may include unreleased changes, or introduce changes that cause issues in apps created using an earlier version.

## Choose the documentation branch

This documentation is built from the same branches, `main` and `devnet`. The `main` branch includes the latest additions and updates to the documentation. You can view the content to learn about upcoming updates to the documentation, but the information may not be accurate or up-to-date for the features and functionality available in the `devnet` branch. In most cases, you should view the `devnet` version of the documentation.

To change branches, choose **Latest build** to view the documentation generated from the `main` branch of the repository. You should not use the **Latest build** version to learn how to install, configure, or build on Sui, as the information may change before the content is merged to **Devnet**. 

## Supported Operating Systems

Sui supports the following operating systems.

* Linux - Ubuntu version 18.04 (Bionic Beaver)
* macOS - macOS Monterey
* Microsoft Windows - Windows 11

>press the `enter` key in the command prompt fix the issue.

>**Known Issue:** The `sui console` command does not work in PowerShell.


## Install Sui binaries

After you install Cargo, use the following command to install Sui binaries:

```shell
$ cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git --branch devnet sui
```

The command installs the following Sui components in `~/.cargo/bin`:
* [`sui`](cli-client.md) - The Sui CLI tool contains subcommands for enabling `genesis` of validators and accounts, starting the Sui network, and [building and testing Move packages](move/index.md), as well as a [client](cli-client.md) for interacting with the Sui network.

Trouble shooting:
If the previous command fails, make sure you have the latest version of Rust installed:

```
rustup update stable
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

### macOS and Linux

Confirm the binaries are installed with:
```
$ echo $PATH
```
### Windows

Confirm the binaries are installed with:
```
$ echo %PATH%
```
And ensure the `.cargo/bin` directory appears. Access the help for any of these binaries by passing the `--help` argument to it.

> **Important:** Make sure your entire toolchain stays up-to-date. If you encounter issues building and installing the Sui binaries, update all packages above and re-install.

## Integrated Development Environment
For Move development, we recommend the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) IDE with the Move Analyzer language server plugin installed:

```shell
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/move-language/move move-analyzer --features "address20"
```

Then follow the Visual Studio Marketplace instructions to install the [Move Analyzer extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=move.move-analyzer). (The `cargo install` command for the language server is broken there; hence, we include the correct command above.)

See more [IDE options](https://github.com/MystenLabs/awesome-move#ides) in the [Awesome Move](https://github.com/MystenLabs/awesome-move) docs.

## SUI tokens

To [experiment with Devnet](../build/devnet.md) or [use the Sui Wallet Browser Extension](../explore/wallet-browser.md), you can add SUI tokens to your account address. 

To request SUI test tokens:

1. Join the [Sui Discord](https://discord.com/invite/sui) If you havenâ€™t already.
1. Identify your address through either the Sui Wallet Browser Extension or by running the following command and electing to connect to a Sui RPC server if prompted:
   ```shell
   $ sui client active-address
   ```
1. Request tokens in the [#devnet-faucet](https://discord.com/channels/916379725201563759/971488439931392130) channel using the syntax: `!faucet <YOUR_ADDRESS>`, for example:
      ```shell
      !faucet 0xd72c2c90ed9d923cb0ed2ca91db5be9e1c9b5ccb
      ```
1. A bot on the channel distributes tokens to you automatically.
